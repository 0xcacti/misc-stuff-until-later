### Misc Stuff Until Later 

This is a repo where I'm gonna hold random little snippets of code that I write in various languages 
for play.  Like right now, I want to understand how C single threaded multiplexing with `select()` works, so
I'm writing a simple echo server that uses `select()` to handle multiple clients at once without threads.
It's not a big enough project to warrant its own repo, so it goes here. I guess I will also use it to learn how poll works. 

Eventually, as I do with many projects, I will completely yeet this and put in a real project


Actually, I want to do more programming with no goal.  Just playing. 
When I play games there is no goal. I want to do the same here.  This 
will be my repo for this. 


I also, just realized that freaking github doesn't count my commits in like other orgs sometimes.
It's messing up my graph when I try to replicate with my own code from sql.  That's bothersome. 
As such, I'll be using this repo to fix any and all old missing commits.
