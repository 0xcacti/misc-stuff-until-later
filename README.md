### Misc Stuff Until Later 

This is a repo where I'm gonna hold random little snippets of code that I write in various languages 
for play.  Like right now, I want to understand how C single threaded multiplexing with `select()` works, so
I'm writing a simple echo server that uses `select()` to handle multiple clients at once without threads.
It's not a big enough project to warrant its own repo, so it goes here. I guess I will also use it to learn how poll works. 

I'm also going to use this to fill out my contributions chart when github doesn't show me as active because I don't have a 
saml sso session (https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/concepts/contributions-on-your-profile)

Eventually, as I do with many projects, I will completely yeet this and put in a real project

Actually, I want to do more programming with no goal.  Just playing. 
When I play games there is no goal. I want to do the same here.  This 
will be my repo for this. 


I'm also gonna use this repo to learn how regex's work
