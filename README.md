### Misc Stuff Until Later 

This is a repo where I'm gonna hold random little snippets of code that I write in various languages 
for play.  Like right now, I want to understand how C single threaded multiplexing with `select()` works, so
I'm writing a simple echo server that uses `select()` to handle multiple clients at once without threads.
It's not a big enough project to warrant its own repo, so it goes here.

Eventually, as I do with many projects, I will completely yeet this and put in a real project
